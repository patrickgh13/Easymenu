 Online Menu system with QR-Code reading and online order system

I created a custome theme for wordpress with woocommerce that can help cafe/restaurants to get rid of printed menus and help customers to see and even submit their orders (and even pay in next version) via their own device or cafe/restaurants tablet.

In the chiled theme, I have some edits on woocoomerce to make it possible to get table number (from qr-code) and submit it in order form.
Sample URL in qr-code: www.yoursiteurl.com/shop/?tableNo=13
